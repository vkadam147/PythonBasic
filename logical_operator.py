#Logical operators are used to combine two or more conditions and give a result of True or False
#and → True if both conditions are True.
#or → True if at least one condition is True.
#not → Reverses the result (True becomes False, False becomes True).

print(a<4 and b==3)

print(a<4 or b==3)
print(not(a))

c=False
